The OnlineLogger class is a custom logger class that extends the WandbLogger class from the pytorch_lightning.loggers module. It is used to log experiment information to the Weights & Biases platform.

Main functionalities
Customizing the experiment log path by using the args.logpath value as the name of the logger.
Setting the project name based on the values of args.benchmark, args.backbone, and args.sup.
Grouping the experiments based on the value of args.fold.
Disabling the logging of the model by setting log_model to False.
Methods
The OnlineLogger class does not define any additional methods. It inherits all the methods from the WandbLogger class.

Fields
args: The arguments passed to the OnlineLogger class constructor.
Usage example
args = {
    'logpath': 'experiment_logs',
    'benchmark': 'benchmark1',
    'backbone': 'resnet50',
    'sup': 'supervised',
    'fold': 1
}

logger = OnlineLogger(args)
