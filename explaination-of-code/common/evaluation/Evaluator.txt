The Evaluator class provides methods for evaluating predictions in classification and segmentation tasks.

Main functionalities
The main functionalities of the Evaluator class are:

Classification evaluation: The cls_prediction method takes a tensor of class scores and ground truth labels, and returns a tensor indicating whether the predictions are correct or not.
Segmentation evaluation: The seg_prediction method takes a tensor of predicted masks and a batch dictionary containing the ground truth masks and ignore indices. It computes the intersection and union between the predicted masks and ground truth masks for each episode in the batch.
Methods
cls_prediction(cls_score, gt): Computes the correctness of classification predictions based on class scores and ground truth labels.
seg_prediction(pred_mask, batch, ignore_index=255): Computes the intersection and union between predicted masks and ground truth masks for segmentation evaluation.
Fields
The Evaluator class does not have any fields.

a. The cls_prediction method in the Evaluator class is used to predict the correctness of a binary classification based on a given threshold. It compares the predicted scores with the ground truth labels and returns a boolean tensor indicating whether the predictions are correct or not.

Inputs
cls_score: A tensor containing the predicted scores for each sample.
gt: A tensor containing the ground truth labels for each sample.
Flow
The method compares the predicted scores (cls_score) with a threshold of 0.5 to obtain the predicted class labels (cls_pred).
It then compares the predicted class labels with the ground truth labels (gt) to determine if the predictions are correct or not.
The method returns a boolean tensor (pred_correct) indicating whether the predictions are correct or not.
Outputs
pred_correct: A boolean tensor indicating whether the predictions are correct or not for each sample.

b. The seg_prediction method in the Evaluator class computes the intersection and union between the predicted mask and the ground-truth mask for each episode in a batch. It also applies an ignore index to the ground-truth mask if specified.

Inputs
pred_mask: The predicted mask for each episode in the batch.
batch: A dictionary containing the ground-truth mask (query_mask) and the ignore index (query_ignore_idx).
Flow
Get the ground-truth mask from the batch.
If an ignore index is specified and exists in the batch, apply it to the ground-truth mask and update the predicted mask accordingly.
Iterate over each predicted mask and ground-truth mask in the batch.
Compute the intersection between the predicted mask and the ground-truth mask.
If the intersection is empty, set the intersection area to [0, 0].
Compute the histogram of the intersection, predicted mask, and ground-truth mask using two bins (0 and 1).
Append the intersection, predicted area, and ground-truth area to their respective lists.
Stack the intersection, predicted area, and ground-truth area tensors.
Compute the union by adding the predicted area and ground-truth area and subtracting the intersection.
Outputs
area_inter: The intersection area between the predicted mask and the ground-truth mask for each episode in the batch.
area_union: The union area between the predicted mask and the ground-truth mask for each episode in the batch.
