from 150 to 158:
The code snippet consists of two functions, read_mask and read_img, which are methods of the DatasetPASCAL class. The read_mask function reads a segmentation mask image file and converts it into a tensor, while the read_img function reads an RGB image file and returns it as a PIL Image object.

Inputs
img_name: A string representing the name of the image file to be read.
Flow
In the read_mask function, the image file path is constructed by joining the ann_path attribute of the DatasetPASCAL class with the img_name parameter, and the file extension ".png" is appended.
The Image.open function is used to open the image file as a PIL Image object.
The PIL Image object is converted into a numpy array using the np.array function.
The numpy array is then converted into a PyTorch tensor using the torch.tensor function.
The resulting tensor is returned as the segmentation mask.
Outputs
For the read_mask function, the output is a PyTorch tensor representing the segmentation mask.
For the read_img function, the output is a PIL Image object representing the RGB image.

The code snippet is a method called sample_episode that is part of the DatasetPASCAL class. It samples a query image and its corresponding support images for a few-shot learning episode.

Inputs
idx: An integer representing the index of the episode.
Flow
If the split is 'val', the random seed is set using the index for reproducibility.
The index is modulo divided by the length of img_metadata to ensure it is within the range of available images.
The query name and query class are retrieved from img_metadata.
The support names list is initialized.
The probability distribution p is created, where each class has an equal probability except for the query class, which has a probability of 0.5.
The support classes are randomly chosen from class_ids based on the probability distribution p.
For each support class, a list of support names is created.
While the length of the support names list is less than the desired number of shots:
A support name is randomly chosen from img_metadata_classwise for the corresponding support class.
If the support name is not equal to the query name and is not already in the support names list, it is added to the list.
The query name, support names, and support classes are returned.
Outputs
query_name: A string representing the name of the query image.
support_names: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the names of the support images for each support class.
support_classes: A list of integers representing the support classes.

The code snippet defines a method called build_class_ids which is a part of the DatasetPASCAL class. This method is responsible for generating a list of class IDs based on the current fold and split of the dataset.

Inputs
The method does not take any explicit inputs. However, it relies on the following instance variables of the DatasetPASCAL class:

self.nclass: the total number of classes in the dataset
self.nfolds: the number of folds in the dataset
self.fold: the current fold of the dataset
self.split: the current split of the dataset (either 'trn' or 'val')
Flow
The method calculates the number of classes in each fold (nclass_val) by dividing the total number of classes by the number of folds.
It generates a list of class IDs for the validation set (class_ids_val) by multiplying the current fold with nclass_val and adding the range from 1 to nclass_val.
It generates a list of class IDs for the training set (class_ids_trn) by iterating over the range from 1 to self.nclass and excluding the class IDs present in class_ids_val.
The method asserts that the combined set of class IDs for the training and validation sets is equal to the total number of classes and that the class ID 0 is not present in either set.
If the current split is 'trn', the method returns class_ids_trn. Otherwise, it returns class_ids_val.
Outputs
The method returns a list of class IDs based on the current fold and split of the dataset.
